== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/send-users-email` directory, or upload the plugin zip file by going to Upload Plugin section on your WordPress dashboard
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in the WordPress dashboard

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I select individual users? =

Absolutely. Go to the `Email Users` page of the plugin and select the user you want to email.

= Can I choose multiple roles? =

Yes. You are able to choose one or multiple roles at a time and email them.

= When are emails sent? =

Emails are processed immediately and there is no delay. However, depending on your hosting or mail service provides, there might be a slight delay in delivery. The PRO version however has an option to send emails via queue, so they do not get sent all at once.

= I am using Gmail as email service provider (or any other provider) and users are not receiving emails. =

This plugin only acts as a bridge between your site and your email service provider. It's up to the email provider to deliver or block sent emails. If your delivery is not consistent, please contact your email provider support or hosting to see if you are hitting their limit. The plugin does attempt to let you know when your emails are not sent. If this happens, please check your logs or email service provider usage for any issues.

= I have many users in my system and many are not getting the emails? =

Since, processing is happening immediately, a low `max execution time` in your server's PHP settings might terminate the process. Try increasing the value for max execution time. You can do this yourself or contact your hosting provider to do it on your behalf. With PRO version of the plugin, you can avoid this issue by adding your emails to the sending queue so that they are sent in multiple batches with the help of WP cron.

= I have an issue/question/suggestion/request? =

Please post refer to our [support form](https://sendusersemail.com/support/?utm_source=wp_repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=faq_support_link).

= Is there a way to try out the plugin before I install it on my website? =

Absolutely. Try it out at [https://tastewp.org/plugins/send-users-email/](https://tastewp.org/plugins/send-users-email/). Please note that this service doesn't allow outgoing email so you will just be trying out the interface and general idea of the features.

= Does the plugin work with all email providers? =

It works with most major providers, but you should check with your email service if they have specific sending limits.

= Can I personalize the emails I send? =

Yes, both the free and [PRO version](https://sendusersemail.com/?utm_source=wp_dir&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=pro_version) allow email personalization using placeholders.

= What happens if an email fails to send? =

Errors will be logged for you to review, so you can identify and address any issues.

= What is the benefit of using the email queue system in the PRO version? =

The queue system ensures your emails are sent gradually, preventing your account from being flagged for sending too many emails at once and improving delivery success.

= Can I schedule emails to be sent later with the free version? =

Scheduling is available only in the [PRO version](https://sendusersemail.com/?utm_source=wp_dir&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=pro_version).

= Whatâ€™s the difference between the free versionâ€™s log retention and the PRO version? =

The free version logs emails for 15 days, while the [PRO version](https://sendusersemail.com/?utm_source=wp_dir&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=pro_version) keeps logs for 90 days (adjustable).
